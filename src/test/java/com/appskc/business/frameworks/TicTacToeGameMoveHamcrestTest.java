/**
 * Demo for testing framework util Hamcrest
 * Some Benefits:
 * - readability
 * - type safety
 * - natively supported by JUnit (org.junit.Assert)
 * - portability: combine with TestNG and JUnit
 * - custom matchers
 *
 * use org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat and org.junit.Assert.assertThat (with and without message),
 * is, not, equalTo, hasSize, containsInAnyOrder from org.hamcrest.Matchers.
 * implement MyHamcrestMatcher.myEqualTo and use it here
